Compile the driver with NXDK: https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk

As is, the driver does almost nothing. You need to set up your own target.

This bit is a convenience function to make psuedo-hypercalls to qemu:
```
void hypercall(int hypercallNum, int arg0, int arg1){

	__asm
	{
		mov edi, [ebp + 8];
		mov esi, [ebp + 12];
		mov edx, [ebp + 16];
		_emit(0x0F);
		_emit(0x24);
	}

	return;

}
```

Then you can use the psuedo-hypercalls as follows:

	(hypercallNums)
	1 - Start Forkserver(ticksEnabled, 0)
	2 - GetWork(ptrToBuffer, len)
	3 - StartWork(startTrace, endTrace)
	4 - EndWork(0, 0)
